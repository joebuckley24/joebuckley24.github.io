<h2>What is the Fed?</h2>

<p>The Federal Reserve, often called the Fed, is the central bank of the United States. Its primary role is to maintain a stable economy by conducting monetary policy. This is done mainly by setting short-term interest rates to control the money supply—the total amount of real and digital dollars circulating in the economy. Changes in the money supply affect the economy, and the Fed aims to set interest rates in a way that fulfills their mandate to maximize employment while limiting inflation. The Federal Reserve also oversees the health and stability of the financial system, with a particular focus on large banks. In essence, the Fed uses its monetary and regulatory powers to positively influence the real economy by reducing fluctuations in the boom-and-bust cycle.</p>

<p>The Fed consists of 12 Federal Reserve Banks and is supervised by its Board of Governors. This Board is a federal agency in Washington, D.C. led by seven governors appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The 12 Federal Reserve Banks are spread across distinct regions in the United States, headquartered in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), made up of the seven governors, the president of the New York Fed, and four rotating Reserve Bank presidents, determines the federal funds rate, which is a key tool for implementing monetary policy. This rate influences short-term interest rates, helping the Fed manage inflation and unemployment.</p>

<h3>How Banks Make Money</h3>

<p>Understanding how modern banks turn a profit is a prerequisite to understanding how the Fed influences the economy via monetary policy. Banks operate on a fractional reserve basis; they accept deposits from savers and lend most of that money to borrowers, while keeping only a small portion in reserve for withdrawals. They make a profit by loaning money to borrowers at a higher interest rate than they pay to savers who have deposits at the bank. When banks extend a loan to a customer, they create new money, and the customer takes the money and spends or invests it. Of course, the bank doesn’t actually print new dollar bills; it doesn’t need to. Instead the loan recipient suddenly finds her account balance reflects the full amount of the loan, and she is free to write checks, wire money, etc. Simultaneously, the customers with money saved at the bank still see their checking and savings accounts full, and the bank maintains its fraction of cash on hand for withdrawals. The supply of money has grown. As the loan recipient’s money gets spent and invested, it finds its way back into the banking system as new deposits and in turn gets lent out, minus the additional fraction of deposits that must be held as reserves. The financial system has evolved to only need a small fraction of cash compared to the overall money supply, and the Fed uses this sophisticated system to steer the economy by propagating changes through the banks into the real economy.</p>

<h3>The Trade-Off of Inflation and Unemployment</h3>

<p>Interest rates incentivize lenders and borrowers differently, affecting the number of new loans. Such changes in the money supply impact economic growth and overall price levels for goods and services. Interest rates may be thought of as the price of money. When interest rates are high, it’s expensive to borrow, as measured by the burden of paying back the lender in future dollars. The higher the rate goes, the less likely someone is willing and able to take out a loan. When financial institutions are unable to extend many loans, it has the effect of slowing down the broader economy. If no one can get a loan to make investments in their business or finance a purchase such as a new car or home, say, the circulation of dollars through the economy becomes sluggish, overall growth slows, and unemployment rises. Conversely, low interest rates make it easier to get a low-cost loan. Most people and businesses can easily borrow and spend money, which spurs economic growth and decreases unemployment. Unfortunately, this often also leads to higher inflation. If dollars become cheap and easily obtained, people will demand comparatively more of them for the same goods and services, and prices throughout the economy rise. This contrasts with a high interest rates scenario, which has the effect of slowing down inflation, sometimes even causing prices to drop. Ideally, a healthy economy sees gradual inflation linked to growth, but excessive inflation can harm both businesses and consumers. Central banks, including the Fed, aim to strike a balance between low unemployment and low inflation, using the tools available to them.</p>

<h3>The Fed and the Banking System</h3>

<p>To recap, banks create money through loans by leveraging a fractional reserve system. When interest rates are low, banks lend more, growing the money supply, boosting economic activity, and potentially spurring inflation. When rates rise, borrowing decreases, slowing down economic growth and reducing inflation. Market forces generally help keep these factors in balance, but economic conditions can lead to periods of persistent inflation or slower growth. Furthermore, the fractional reserve system has another risk, which the sharp reader may already have intuitively grasped. Recall that the bank doesn’t just hold all the dollars in their vault that customers deposit. If that was their business plan, they would need YOU to pay THEM to safeguard your money. Instead, they take most of that money and lend it back out, keeping only a small amount at the bank for when customers need to withdraw some or all of their funds. The downside is that if everyone came to get their money from the bank all at once, the bank would be unable to meet their demand since that money is tied up in the previous loans and investments that the bank made. This is called a run on the bank, and it generally leads to the bank’s collapse unless an outside force intervenes. A run on the bank might arise from true mismanagement, such as making poor investment decisions, or it might just be a rumor that sparks a rush of depositors to panic about the safety of their money (often it’s a bit of both). </p>

<p>Above, we said a run on the bank would likely cause its collapse, unless an outside force intervened. Enter the Fed. Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 in response to the Panic of 1907, when a series of bank runs had spiraled into a global financial crisis. This established the Federal Reserve as the central banking system of the US, and by the mid-20th century, the governance structure of the Fed largely resembled its form today. Then and now, banks over a certain size were required to keep their reserves at the Fed, and so if one bank’s customers wanted to withdraw a lot of money in a short time, the bank could simply borrow from another bank that had excess reserves at the Fed. The rate at which these banks lend cash to one another is the federal funds rate. Because these big banks are the most creditworthy entities that one can lend to, the fed funds rate is the lowest short-term rate one can pay to borrow money. When the banks can borrow from one another at low rates, they pass on these lower rates to consumers and businesses, making it easier to get a loan and increasing the supply of money and credit in the economy. Conversely, when the fed funds rate is higher, banks are forced to demand higher interest rates from borrowers, shrinking the money supply and dampening economic growth. Although the Fed is unable to simply decree what interest rates shall be, it uses its regulatory power to set a short-term interest rate for banks that is passed on to everyone else. The Fed can raise the fed funds rate if inflation is running too hot, disincentivizing borrowers and slowing down the broader economy, and it can lower the rate once inflation is under control, allowing for more economic growth and job creation. Ultimately, the causal relationship between the fed funds rate and interest rates more generally allows the Fed to influence interest rates to achieve its goals of low unemployment while keeping inflation in check.</p>

<h3>So What?</h3>

<p>Borrowing and saving money is a fundamental component of society, and interest rates are a nominal measurement of how easy it is to do so. The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy and corresponding choice of federal funds rate affect the whole world, considering the global adoption of the dollar. This is true on a macro and micro scale. Interest rates impact a country’s growth, inflation, currency exchange rate, stock markets, and many other variables. At the same time, they impact many big decisions in life, such as buying a house, investing in a new business, taking out a loan for college, and countless smaller ones too. Understanding how the Fed works isn’t just for economists— it’s important knowledge for anyone who borrows, saves, or otherwise transacts in dollars.</p>
